							<!-- <span class="image main right"><img src="images/mike.jpg" alt="Mike portrait" /></span> -->
							<p>Runners Playground is a run club and a runner's school all in one. It's much more than just 'going for a run'. Our focus is about teaching runners how to run, and to equip our runners with the tools they need to train both the brain AND the body.</P>
							<p>We're all about building stronger AND smarter runners, so there is just as much an emphasis on running technique, skill development, injury prevention and education as there is on the actual programming. </p>
							<p>All of our weekly structured running sessions (including intervals, hills, tempo & aerobic training) are accompanied with running drills to work on technique development, both to improve running efficiency & reduce risk of injury. We place a large emphasis on explaining the ‘why’s’ of our training, the purpose of each type of session, what each drill is working to improve and educating our runners.</p>
